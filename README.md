### 🎯 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student currently in my 6th semester. I work as a Junior Development Support Analyst, bridging the gap between infrastructure and software development. I also have a strong interest in Infrastructure and Cybersecurity.
On my free time, I am deeply focused on improve my Back-end skills, currently building projects with C#, C++ and TypeScript. I'm also exploring Java for both enterprise applications and game development hobbies.
